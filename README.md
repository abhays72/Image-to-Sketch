# Image-to-Sketch

This is inspired by my abysmal drawing skills, which were made clear when I tried to make a portrait of my friend that turned out horribly. So, like all things, I just wrote a program to do it for me in a fraction of the time.
I hope to add more styles and settings that can be edited by the users to fine-tune the program to suit their needs.
